The goal of this report is to try to fake knowing what I'm doing, while actually not having a **clue**

## Psychonalaysis 

Anyway since I really like depths psychology : 

1. Are 
2. you
3. subject 
4. to 
5. the 
6. Oedipal complex ? 
7. *Because I do*



# The man himself 

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Sigmund Freud being a freaking badss", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Sigmund_Freud,_by_Max_Halberstadt_(cropped).jpeg")
```


**Now let's get to something else**

Since I *didn't* find any data about your oedipal complex, I had to find something else. What else then, than some data about the Titanic, in order to find out if Jack could've fit on that floating wooden door ? Hmm ? 



```{r}
data("Titanic")
summary("Titanic")
```

No need to consult the data , the answer is self-evident ; yes he **could've**
