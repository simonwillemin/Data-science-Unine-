# Goal

The goal of this report is to try to fake knowing what I’m doing, while
actually not having a **clue**

## Psychonalaysis

Anyway since I really like depths psychology :

1.  Are
2.  you
3.  subject
4.  to
5.  the
6.  Oedipal complex ?

**Now let’s get to something else**

something else. What else then, than some data about the Titanic, in
order to find out if Jack could’ve fit on that floating wooden door ?
Hmm ?

``` r
data("Titanic")
summary("Titanic")
```
