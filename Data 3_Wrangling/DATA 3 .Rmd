## Filtering 

Let's first `filter()` the data for the United States and put them in a dataframe.
```{r}
USA_country_filter <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "United States")
```

Let's now do that for Switzerland 

```{r}
Switzerland_country_filter <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Switzerland")
```

## Selecting

Let's now `select()` some interesting variable for the USA

```{r}
USA_selected <- USA_country_filter %>%
  select(fertility, population, year)
  
str(USA_selected)
head(USA_selected) %>% kable()
tail(USA_selected) %>% kable()
```

And the same for Switzerland 

```{r}
Switzerland_selected <- Switzerland_country_filter %>%
  select(fertility, population, year)
  
str(Switzerland_selected)
head(Switzerland_selected) %>% kable()
tail(Switzerland_selected) %>% kable()
```


## Arranging 
```{r}
USA_selected %>%
  arrange(year)
```

We can here notice that the overall fertility rates drop over the years, while the population constantly increases. 
Interestingly, after a lower-than-two fertility rate period in the 70's, it increased again later on, and stabilized.

```{r}
Switzerland_selected %>%
  arrange(year)
```

Whereas in Switzerland, it was at first (in the 1960's) lower than in the US at the same period. However, it shrank more regularly and is now at a low since the 1980's already ! 

## Group by and Summarize

```{r}
na.omit(gapminder) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(total_fertility = sum (fertility)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_fertility)) %>%
  head()
```

```{r}
na.omit(gapminder) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(total_fertility = sum (fertility)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_fertility)) %>%
  tail()
```

We can here usprisingly notice that the most fertile country (over the years) is an african country, namely Rwanda. Also, the least fertile one is Ireland. 

## Merging

We could for instance merge the `results_us_election_2016` and `murders` datasets. 

```{r}
head(full_join(results_us_election_2016, murders)) %>% kable()
```
